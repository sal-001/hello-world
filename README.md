This repository is for practicing the GitHub Workflow.

I have a strong interest in game development and storytelling. Currently, I am developing a 2D based fighting game in Unity, which showcases my technical skills and dedication to creating immersive experiences. With 7 years of experience in software development and an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in Information Technology (IT), I bring a solid foundation of expertise to my projects.

My focus on character development, including unique backstories and diverse abilities, highlights my attention to detail and desire to craft a rich, engaging world. I also have a keen eye for aesthetics and design, appreciating visual representations and pixel art. Currently, I am furthering my education by studying to earn my Bachelor's degree, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
